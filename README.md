Purpose:
-----------
With an increasing number of dams reaching their life expectancy decisions need to be made on recertification vs. removal.  Being able to quickly access the most relevant dam removal science can be a lengthy task that is not straight forward.
In addition, there are a number of gaps in current dam removal science.  Being able to retrieve available information can help inform future scientific studies.
-----------
Additional Details:
-----------
We will be using methods outlined in Foley et al 2017.  A stakeholder will identify a dam that is under review for removal.  Physical dam characteristics and landscape characteristics will be used to identify science on similar dams..
